# Dotfiles
This used to only be for my vim config, however it now contains all config files that will need to be transferred between installs, including scripts.

## Installation
To install on a new system, clone this repo then run `./setup.sh`. For help, use the `-h` option.

## TODO
* get it to install on other systems, and test for what system it is being run on
* make included bash files for common functions to lessen code repetition
